<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">This is the scene content for Scene 1.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">As she stepped into the old café, the bell above the door let out a tired clang, echoing through the dimly lit room. Lena's eyes scanned the familiar space, taking in the worn wooden tables and the faint scent of freshly brewed coffee.</p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><br /></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">She slid onto a stool at the counter, her hips sinking into the soft cushion as she gazed out the rain-streaked window. The droplets pattered against the glass, creating a soothing melody that seemed to wash away the stress of the day.</p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><br /></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">The barista, a young woman with a bright pink streak in her hair, raised an eyebrow as Lena took out her phone and began typing on the screen. &quot;Just here for coffee,&quot; she mouthed, not looking up from her phone.</p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><br /></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">The barista nodded knowingly, her eyes flicking to the cup she was pouring steaming hot water into. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee filled the air, mingling with the scent of wet pavement outside.</p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><br /></p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Lena's thumbs moved quickly over the screen as she typed out a response to an unread message. Her mind wandered to the conversation that had led her here, and the uncertainty that still lingered in her thoughts.</p></body></html>
