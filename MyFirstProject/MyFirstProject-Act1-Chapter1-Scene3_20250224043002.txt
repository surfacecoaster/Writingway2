This is the scene content for Scene 3.
Alice stood at the edge of the dense forest, her feet sinking into the damp earth as she gazed out at the unfamiliar landscape before her. The fading sunlight cast long shadows across the trees, making it seem as though the very forest itself was alive and watching her.

She shivered slightly, despite the warmth of the summer evening. Memories of the events that had led her here still felt like a distant nightmare - the fire that had ravaged her village, the death of her parents at the hands of the ruthless bandit lord, Malakai.

Taking a deep breath, Alice steeled herself for what lay ahead. She knew she couldn't stay in one place for too long; the villagers who had taken her in were kind, but they weren't equipped to protect her from those who would seek revenge for her parents' defiance of Malakai's rule.

As she turned to make her way back through the trees, Alice heard a faint rustling in the underbrush. Her hand instinctively went to the dagger at her waist, and she tensed, ready to defend herself if necessary.

A figure emerged from the shadows - a young woman with a scar above her left eyebrow and a determined look on her face. "Alice," the woman said softly, as though trying not to startle her. "I've been looking for you."
