To better assist you in writing this scene in Third Person Limited point of view and Past Tense, I need some information on Alice's character. 

Please provide me with details such as:

- Age
- Personality traits (e.g., introverted, optimistic)
- Goals or motivations for leaving her home
- Any specific habits or quirks that could be used to describe her in this scene
- Her background and where she is headed

With these details, I can proceed with writing the next part of the scene.
